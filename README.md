# OTHOUNDSTO

This is a sketch of an experimental musical composition technique I've been
developing. I discuss it at length in my upcoming book Fun Musical Ideas,
the chapter called "Yaw". Essentially, we have sheet music that rotates as the
play cursor combs over it, creating interesting textures as the horizontal
component, time, shifts gradually into the vertical component, pitch, and vice
versa.

For my initial illustrative example, I use the houndstooth pattern as music.
The borders between black and white are what's played. The tiled pattern tilts
back and forth, teetering ever more violently. It changes directions each time
it attains a key orientation at which vertices of the houndstooth pattern align
either vertically or horizontally or both (creating chords or mono-pitch
rhythms).

The piece exhibits pitch circularity. The play cursor could not extend
infinitely upwards and downwards or too much sound would be heard, plus the
tiniest tilt would result in total cacophany. So the loudest sounds come from
the center of the bar, and the extreme tops and bottoms are almost not even
there insofar as the sounds they pick up are almost silent (the falloff follows
the curve of a normal distribution).
